        <h1>New beginnings.</h1>
        <p>Audentes fortuna iuvat - fortune favors the bold.</p>

        <p>Veni vidi vici  - I came, I saw, I conquered.</p>

        <p>Memento morí - remember you must die.</p>

        <p>We fall, we break, we fail. But then we rise, we heal. We overcome.</p>

        <p>Do you wanna walk around knowing that you could, but you didn’t?</p>

        <p>Excuses make today easier but tomorrow hard. Discipline makes today hard but tomorrow easier.</p>

        <p>Set goals so high that every failure is higher than other’s successes.</p>

        <p>Move in silence. Only speak when it is time to say ‘checkmate.’</p>

        <p>It is not death that a man should fear. But he should fear never beginning to live.</p>

        <p>Be better than the man God wanted you to be.</p>

        <p>Do it alone. Do it broke. Do it tired. Do it scared. Just do it.</p>

        <p>Every man has two lives. The second begins when he realizes he only has one.</p>

        <p>Stop waiting for the right time. Time isn’t waiting for you.</p>

        <p>I am not what happened to me. I am what I chose to become.</p>

        <p>Real men despise battle, but will never run from it.</p>

        <p>If you chase butterflies, they will all fly away, but if you build a beautiful garden, they will come to you. Even if they don’t come, you still have a beautiful garden.</p>

        <p>What is written hereafter is truly something unbelievable, but everything is the truth, so make sure to read until the very end.</p>

        <p>The game ends when your king falls, not when a pawn takes your queen.</p>

        <p>Accept what you can’t change. Change what you can’t accept.</p>

        <p>If it was easy, everyone would do it.</p>

        <p>Move with strategy, not emotion. A calm mind makes a wiser decision.</p>

        <p>Don’t lose yourself trying to please everyone. Lose everyone trying to please yourself.</p>

        <p>Don’t quit. Nothing last forever, not even pain.</p>

        <p>Why do we fall, sir? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.</p>

        <p>Your future needs you. Not your past. Don’t give up.</p>

        <p>Nothing is impossible unless you convince your consciousness it is.</p>

        <p>If I am killed, I can die but once. But to live in constant dread of it is to die over and over again.</p>

        <p>Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner.</p>

        <p>You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do.</p>

        <p>Nobody is coming to save you. Get up. Be your own hero.</p>

        <p>The moment when you want to quit is the moment when you need to keep pushing.</p>

        <p>Obsessive is the word the lazy use to describe the dedicated.</p>

        <p>Average is the enemy, success is your responsibility, and change can take place in an instant if you are willing to flip the switch.</p>

        <p>Don’t quit. Nothing lasts forever. Not even pain.</p>

        <p>Become a ghost. Forget attention. Just grow in private.</p>

        <p>When it feels scary to jump, that is exactly when you jump.</p>

        <p>Anybody who has no need of anyone other than himself is either a beast or a god.</p>

        <p>Some are born great. Others achieve greatness.</p>

        <p>If you don’t sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice.</p>

        <p>If they stand behind you, protect them. If they stand beside you, respect them. If they stand against you, show them no mercy. </p>

        <p>The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight. The only reason a warrior fights is to win.</p>

        <p>Don’t spread yourself out too thin. Learn to say no politely. And quickly.</p>

        <p>Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.</p>
